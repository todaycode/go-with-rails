Description:
    generate Golang app by Rails models: use Rails as a model and migration tool to build a Golang app, or migrate some of existed Rails APIs to Golang to decouple and high-perform your services.

Example:
    rails generate gor development -m user post

    Here are valid ENV_NAME arguments: [dev, development, pro, production, test], the default ENV_NAME is "development" if you omit it.

    So you can also run:

    rails g gor dev -m user post

    This will mainly create:
        go_app/main.go
        go_app/db/conn.go
        go_app/models/user/gor_user.go
        go_app/models/user/gor_post.go

    Notice: If you omit the -m option, all the models of the Rails app will be generated.

    So if you omit all the options, just run:

    rails g gor

    This will generate all the models and database connection with Rails development env params.
